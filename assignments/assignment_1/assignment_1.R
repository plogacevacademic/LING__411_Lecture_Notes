# create a vector named x by assigning it all numbers between 1 and 25

# compute the average of this vector

# determine how many elements the vector has

# convert this integer vector to a character vector


# load the 'warlpiri' data.frame from the package 'languageR'

# display the first 3 lines of the data.frame

# look up the meaning of the various columns in the data.frame

# find out how many rows are in the data.frame

# find out which values can occur in the column which indicates the presence of ergative case marking

# determine the overall frequency of ergative case marking in the data set

## In *separate commands*, determine the frequency of ergative case marking as a function of the variables listed
## below, and please save the results in the specified data frames. Inspect the data frames with View() to make
## sure that the results makes sense.
# ... (i) word order (save in data frame called 'proportions_by_WO')
# ... (ii) overtness of object  (save in data frame called 'proportions_by_ovObject')
# ... (iii) animacy of the object (save in data frame called 'proportions_by_animObj')

# create plots in ggplot2 (with lines or bars)  from each of the data.frames from the previous step


## Respond with a a comment below:
## Does there seem to be a relation between ergative case marking and ...
## ... word order

## ... overtness of the object

## ... animacy of the object
