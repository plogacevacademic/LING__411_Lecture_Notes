# Deterministic Linear Models 

In this section we are going to explore **deterministic** linear models, i.e. linear models that work on **idealized** data, when there is no measurement error, and when the *'correct'* model describing the data is known.

The typical dataset we will be working with has a structure similar to the one below:

| dependent variable | predictor 1 | predictor 2 | (further predictors) |
|-----|:----|:-----|:------|
|2.95 | 1.1 | 2.2  | (...) |
|9.1  | 2.9 | -4.0 | (...) |
|5    | 3.1 | -1.4 | (...) |
| ... | ... | ...  | (...) |


The basic form of a linear regression model, in a form that works for *idealized* data:
<!-- 
- What is regression?
- What is linear about this model?
-->

$$ \underbrace{y}_{\text{dependent variable}} =
            \overbrace{\underbrace{a}_{\text{intercept}}}^{\text{additive term}} + 
            \overbrace{\underbrace{b_1}_{\text{slope}} * \underbrace{x_1}_{\text{predictor}}}^{\text{additive term}} + 
            \overbrace{\underbrace{b_2}_{\text{slope}} * \underbrace{x_2}_{\text{predictor}}}^{\text{additive term}} +  
            \ldots$$
<!--  \overbrace{\ldots}^{\text{more additive terms}} -->
            
Two types are usually distinguished: *single-variable*, and *multi-variable* (also: *simple linear regression*, *multiple linear regression*).
<!-- 'univariate', and 'multivariate' stand for the number of dependent variables, *not* the number of predictors  -->

Throughout this course, we will make use of the (Generalized) Linear Model as the main statistical model because it is:

- fairly easy to use

- suffficiently versatile for most practical purposes

- well-studied

## Single-variable models

Let's take a look at a dataset of taxi rides in an unknown city. Imagine that I have taken `r nrow(cab_fares)` taxi rides, and recorded the travel distance, as well as the taxi fare for reach ride. 
The following plot shows each of these measurements as a point with the distances (in km) on the x-axis, and the fare (in Mongolian tögrög; MNT) on the y-axis. This dataset is interesting, because you probably understand the typical relationships between ride distance and fare fairly well, so it is an ideal example for illustrating linear models.

```{r carsPerfect1, fig.height=2.5, echo=FALSE}
cab_fares1 %>% ggplot(aes(distance_km, fare_mnt)) + geom_point() + xlab("distance (km)") + ylab("fare (MNT)")
```

Unsurprisingly, we can see clearly that the fare increases with distance. In other words, *distance* and *fare* have a positive relationship (if one increases, so does the other). 
The relationship between the two variables is so strong that if we know the value of one of the two variables for a particular data point, we can predict the value of the other with a high degree of confidence. (You might want to say that I can predict if with *absolute certainty*, but that presupposes precise knowledge of the cab fare system in that city, *and* an extreme degree of trust towards the local taxi drivers. Let's assume that we don't have either.)

We can make that prediction with such a high degree of certainty because all the points seem to lie on a line. If we learned the function that describes this line, we could learn much more from this dataset than the simple fact that the two variables a positive correlated. That is unsurprising to begin with, but we may want to know **how exactly** they are related. 

A simple way to capture this relationship is to try and describe it with this function:

$$ \text{fare} = a + b * \text{distance} $$

What this equation says is that if we take a value for distance, multiply it by *some number* called $b$, and then add *another number* called $a$, we will know the fare that corresponds to this distance. (In other words, this equation posits that the relationship between *distance* and *fare* is - at least approximately - linear.[^1]) In this particular case the relationship is $\text{fare} = 4 + 2.5 * \text{distance}$, which means that $a=4$, and $b=2.5$. We can verify that this equation is indeed the correct generalization by visualizing this function as a line in the plot below: As you can see, it accurately describes all the points in the graph. 

[^1]: Please note that we don't neeed to assume that the *'true relationship'* between the two variables is actually linear. Most interesting relationships are not linear. However, we can still learn a lot about them from a linear model as you will see in the following.
<!-- to-do: In the following, sprinkle in sections about what we can still learn even if the relationship is not actually linear. -->

```{r carsPerfect2, fig.height=2.5, echo=FALSE}
cab_fares1 %>% ggplot(aes(distance_km, fare_mnt)) + geom_point() + xlab("distance (km)") + ylab("fare (MNT)") + geom_abline(intercept = 4, slope = 2.5, color = "red")
```

Importantly, if we conceptualize $a$ and $b$ as just some numbers that we need to add and multiply by, we will miss an important insight: Both numbers have useful interpretations. In this case, $a$ and $b$ can be interpreted as follows: 

- $a$ (called the **intercept**) can be interpreted as the value of *fare* when *distance* is 0. In this case, the intercept is $4~MNT$, which is the amount you have to pay if you get in and change your mind after the taxometer has been switched on (if the taxi driver is a real stickler for rules).

- $b$ (called the **slope** for **distance**) can be interpreted as the additional amount of money you have to pay for every additional kilometer travelled. A slope of $2.5$ means that a distance increase of $1~km$ increases the stopping distance by $2.5~MNT$.   

The plot below illustrates these interpretations:

```{r, fig.height=3.5, echo=FALSE}
  a = 4; b1 = 2.5;

  p <- cab_fares1 %>% ggplot(aes(distance_km, fare_mnt)) + geom_point()
  p <- p + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0) + 
            geom_abline(intercept = a, slope = b1, color = "red")
  
  p <- p %>% labelled_arrow(x_start=0, y_start=0, x_end=0, y_end=a,
                            x_label = 1.5, y_label = 2, 
                            label = "Intercept", color = "blue")

  p %>% labelled_slope_arrow(x_start=0, y_start=a, x_end=1, y_end=a+b1, 
                             x_label = 2, y_label = a+b1/2, label = "Slope", color = "green")

```

<!-- TODO: Take-away message. -->


## Multi-variable models

Let's imagine that this imaginary city has many bridges. Since I wasn't sure whether bridge tolls apply, I also recorded the number of bridges crossed on each trip. In the previous section, we've looked at the subset of data where no bridges were crossed. Let's see how the fare depends not only on distance travelled, but also on the number of bridges crossed.

Now, we are looking at the relationship between three variables, and the data frame looks as follows:

```{r }
DT::datatable(cab_fares2 %>% dplyr::select(fare_mnt, distance_km, n_bridges), options = list(searching = FALSE), rownames = FALSE)
```

We will again assume that the relationship between fare, distance and number of bridges is linear, and that they contribute to the fare independently. We can now describe the relationship with the following equation:
$$ fare = a + b_1 * distance + b_2 * N_{bridges} $$
The correct parameter values for this equation are $a=4$, $b_1 = 2.5$ (as previously), and $b_2=5$. The interpretation of the coefficients is similar to the previous section:

- $a$ (the **intercept**) is the fare when no bridges have been crossed, and the travel distance is zero.[^2] 

- $b_1$ (the **slope** for **distance**) is the additional fare for every additional kilometer.

- $b_2$ (the **slope** for **$N_{bridges}$**) is the additional fare for every additional bridge.

[^2]: While the number of bridges depends on distance, it is in principle possible to cross a bridge while keeping the travel distance below a kilometer, in which case it would count as zero.

<!-- Consider 
- integrating how the intercept wouldn't make any sense with number of passengers. 
- use day/night for an interaction. 
-->

The following plot shows the data vis-à-vis the linear model fits. Because we are dealing with a relationship between three variables, every datapoint is a point in three-dimensional space (x-axis: distance, y-axis: number of bridges, z-axis: fare). The multi-variable model fit is illustrated by the black plane which rises with increasing distance and/or number of bridges crossed.

If you enable the display of the single-variable model from the last section, you'll see that it also describes a plane: However, the plane corresponding to the single-variable model does not rise with the number of bridges crossed. This is because it is not used as a predictor in that model. 

You will also notice that the red plane and the black plane intersect in a line at $N_{bridges} = 0$. This is because the two model equations $a + b_1 * distance$ and  $a + b_1 * distance + b_2 * N_{bridges}$ are equivalent for $N_{bridges} = 0$.

    s3d$plane3d(Intercept = 10, x.coef = 2.5, y.coef = 0, col = "red")
  }
  s3d
})
```


## Models with categorical predictors

Predictors on the **nominal** or **ordinal scale** (as opposed to **ratio**, or **interval scale**) are not naturally represented by numbers. 
For example: Speaker gender, Presence or absence of wh-movement, word order (e.g., SOV, SVO, VSO), size (long, short).
We can represent them numerically, but there are many coding options. We can represent a factor with two levels by 0 and 1, or by -1 and 1, or by +0.5 and -0.5. 

In the case of the taxi fares, one such predictor is the color of the taxi: I've observed red and blue taxis, and I didn't know if there is possibly a difference in their pricing. In order to determine whether there is, I decided to take a ride in both types. (All the data in the previous sections was for yellow cabs only.)

The following plot shows the relationship between fare and cab color (for $distance=10~km$, and $N_{bridges} = 0$). The x-axis shows the **contrast** for cab color (*the numerical representation of of the categorical variable 'color'*). The y-axis shows the cab fare. 

While the choice of the coding scheme is somwewhat arbitraty, it will affect the interpretation of the coefficients.
<!-- Make sure whe word 'coefficients' is known at this point, ideally by moving the deterministic form of the LM forward. -->
In other words, **model parameterization** (or: **contrast specification**) affects the meaning of the coefficients. 
We will use the following equation to describe the relationship:

$$ \text{fare} = a + b * \text{cCabColorRed} $$, where $cCabColorRed$ is a numerical representation of the cab color. 

We can use **treatment contrasts** (yellow = 0, red = 1) or **sum contrasts** (yellow = -0.5, red = 0.5). 

When we use **treatment contrasts**, the coefficients receive the following interpretation:

- $a$: the fare ride in a yellow taxi (for a $10 km$ ride, when no bridges have been crossed).

- $b$: the fare difference between a ride in a red taxi and a yellow taxi (for a $10 km$ ride, when no bridges have been crossed).

When we use **sum contrasts**, the coefficients receive the following interpretation:

- $a$ the average of the fares for a ride in a yellow taxi and one in a red taxi (for a $10 km$ ride, when no bridges have been crossed).[^3] 

- $b$ the fare difference between a ride in a red taxi and a yellow taxi (for a $10 km$ ride, when no bridges have been crossed).

[^3]: Please note that it is the average of the two fares, and **not** the average fare. <!-- Explain how they are different -->

    p <- p + geom_abline(intercept = a, slope = b1, color = "red")
  }

    p <- p + geom_hline(yintercept = 0) + geom_vline(xintercept = 0)
    p <- p %>% labelled_arrow(x_start = 0, y_start = 0, x_end = 0, y_end = a, 
                              x_label = .1, y_label = 8, label = "Intercept", color = "blue")
    p <- p %>% labelled_slope_arrow(x_start = 0, y_start = a, x_end = 1, y_end = a + b1,
                                    x_label = .9, y_label = 40, label = "Slope", color = "green")
      
  }
  p + ggtitle(sprintf("fare = %0.2f + %0.2f*x", a, b1))
})
```




## Centered predictors

Now let's imagine that I don't know if the number of passengers affects the fare. So far I've been riding alone. Now let's look at a few rides with several other people ($distance = 10~km$, $N_{bridges} = 0$, yellow cabs only). 

As previously, we will model the relationship with a linear equation:

$$ \text{fare} = a + b * \text{number of passengers} $$

However if we model it like this, our intercept is `r cab_intercept + 10*cab_slope_distance - 1*cab_slope_npassengers` as you see in the plot below, and not `r cab_intercept + 10*cab_slope_distance`, as we would expect. We did travel 10 km, after all. - Why is the fare so low?

The reason is that the intercept is the value of the fare when **all** predictors are 0 - yes, even the number of passengers. Barring any extremely unusual situations, this is not actually possible, and therefore an intercept of this kind is really just a number we need to plug into the equation. In other words, we don't learn anything from it.

In order to remedy the situation and obtain a more useful intercept, we can **center** the predictor - that is, subtract the average of the vector from the vector itself. In this case, since the average number of passengers is $2.5$, we will use

$$\text{fare} = a + b * (\text{number of passengers}-2.5)$$

This will leave us with the following interpretations of the coefficients:

- $a$: the fare paid for the average number of passengers, in this case for 2.5 passengers (on a 10 km ride, crossing 0 bridges, in a yellow cab)

- $b$: the additional fare for every additional passenger (on a 10 km ride, crossing 0 bridges, in a yellow cab)

As you see, centering the predictor in a single-variable model changes the meaning of the intercept. As you can verify in the above plot, centering makes the intercept correspond to the cab fare at the *average number of passengers* (instead of *at zero passengers*).
This change in interpretation is because centering changes the interpretation of the zero point of the predictor. While zero corresponds to *no passengers* when the predictor for the number of passengers is uncentered, it corresponds to the average number of passengers when it is centerered. The data is "moved to the left", so to say. Because the intercept corresponds to the value of the fare at zero, the intercept changes as a result of centering.

In sum, centering predictors in single-variable models can help obtain interpretable coefficients.



## Main effects and interactions

So far, we've assumed that the effects of all variables are strictly additive. What if they are not?
Previously, we've only looked at taxi rides during the day. What about night fares? 
(We're looking at $N_{bridges} = 0$, yellow cabs only, one passenger). 

We could model the relationship with the following equation, but in doing so we would neglect that night fares might not be an additive constant, such as $b$ in the equation below, but might actually affect the price paid per kilometer.
$$ \text{fare} = a + b * cNight$$, where $cNight$ is the contast for whether or not we're riding at night time.

It turns out that we can account for that too:

$$ \text{fare} = a + b_1 * distance + b_2 * cNight + b_3 * distance * cNight $$




```{r, eval = FALSE }

n = 30
cab_slope_night = 10
cab_slope_nightByDistance = 1
  
cab_fares5 <- data.frame(
        distance_km = 10,
        n_bridges = 0,
        cab_color_red = 0,
        n_passengers = 1,
        is_night = c(0,1)
        )

cab_fares5$fare_mnt <- with(cab_fares5, cab_intercept + 
                                        cab_slope_distance * distance_km + 
                                        cab_slope_nbridges * n_bridges + 
                                        cab_slope_color_red * cab_color_red +
                                        cab_slope_npassengers * (n_passengers-1) +
                              
                                        cab_slope_night * is_night +
                                        cab_slope_nightByDistance * is_night * distance
                                        )

```

<!-- In all these sections, I never actually tell how I arrive at the model estimates. I should probably mention this in a few words somewhere at the beginning of section 2. -->



## Centered predictors and their effect on main effect and interaction coefficients

Let's take a look the effect of cab color and cab size. What I didn't mention before is that cabs come in two different sizes: 5-seaters, and 9-seaters. I want to find out whether larger cabs cost more. We'll be looking at a subset of data with $distance = 10~km$, and $N_{bridges}=0$, only day rides.

We will set up numerical contrasts for the predictors for cab color (yellow and red), and cab size (5-seaters and 9-seaters), and model the relationship with the following linear equation. This means that we are trying to estimate the main effects of cab color and size, as well as their interaction.

$$ \text{fare} = a + b_1 * \text{cCabColorRed} + b_2 * \text{cCabSize9Seater} + b_3 * \text{cCabColorRed} * \text{cCabSize9Seater}  $$

The plots below illustrate the relationship between the numerical contrasts and cab fare.

We can treat the predictors in one of two ways[^4]: We can either encode them using *treatment contrasts*, or using *sum contrasts*. Let's review in turn what happens when we use each of those contrast coding schemes. 

[^4]: There are more ways to encode the predictors, but these are the most common ones. 


If we use treatment contrasts, the combinations of our predictors can be reduced to the four unique cases below. The first three columns indicate the encoding of the color contrast (yellow=0, red=1) and size contrast (5-seater=0, 9-seater=1), and the interaction predictor (the product of the previous two). The next column illustrates what happens when we plug these predictors into the equation above. In other words, it shows how we can construct the predicted fare from the coefficients of the linear model. Finally, the last column illustrates the simplified version of the predicted value of the fare, with all terms which equal zero removed.

This table below illustrates that 

- The intercept $a$ corresponds to the fare for yellow 5-seaters (it is the only non-zero term in row (1a)). 

- The slope $b_1$ corresponds to the *effect of color for 5-seaters only* (it is the difference between rows (1c) and (1a)).

- The slope $b_2$ corresponds to the *effect of size for yellow cabs only* (it is the difference between rows (1b) and (1a)).


- The slope $b_3$ corresponds to the **additional** *effect of size for red cabs*. Alternatively, it can be understood as the  **additional** *effect of color for 9-seaters*.
<!-- Isn't there a good way to illustrate it with a difference? -->

(In understaning the above reasoning it may help not to focus on how $a,b_1,b_2$ and $b_3$ are obtained, but rather focus on how $a,b_1,b_2$ and $b_3$ would behave in the above equations if they corresponded to the meaning I assigned them.)

|     | color | size | color $\cdot$ size
|:----|:----|:-----|:-|:-|:-----|
|*(1a)*|$0$  | $0$| $0$ |$fare = a + 0 \cdot b_1  + 0 \cdot b_2 + 0 \cdot b_3$ | $= a$

|*(1d)*|$1$  | $1$| $1$ |$fare = a + 1 \cdot b_1  + 1 \cdot b_2 + 1 \cdot b_3$ | $= a + b_1 + b_2 + b_3$


One of the problems with the above coefficient interpretations is that in most cases they are not quite what we are looking for. In most cases, we'll be interested in the average effect of cab color, the average effect of cab size, and the interaction between the two, and **not** in the effect of color for small cabs, the effect size for yellow cabs, and the interaction between the two. While we can compute one set of coefficients from the other, the former are far more informative.

Using sum contrasts will give us more informative coefficients. The table below also illustrates that:

- The intercept $a$ corresponds to the average fare in the data set (the average of the rows (2a-d) is $a$). 

- The slope $b_1$ corresponds to the ** average** *effect of size* (the average of (2a,b) minus the average of (2c,d) is $b_1$).

- The slope $b_2$ corresponds to the ** average** *effect of color* (the average of (2a,c) minus the average of (2b,d) is $b_2$).

- The slope $b_3$ corresponds to the **additional** *effect of size for red cabs*. Alternatively, it can be understood as the  **additional** *effect of color for 9-seaters*.

-->

So far, we have been working with specific subsets of the data which kept all variables that were irrelevant for our present purposes constant (e.g., $distance=10~km$, $N_{bridges} = 0$). We were able to do that because we knew which variables are relevant since the dataset was created artificially. In real-life scenarios this is not always possible - not even when describing a deterministic system such as the cab fare pricing scheme. This is because (i) we often don't know all the relevant variables, (ii) we don't know in which ways they may interact, and (iii) even if we knew all that, we may be left with very little data if we keep taking subsets with specific characteristics all the time. (For example, a dataset with $N_{bridges} = 0$ may not have a lot of rides with $distance > 1~km$ if the city has many bridges, as I said this particular city did.)   
<!-- Include this?: Moreover, some variables may not have been recorded. --> 

The bottom line is that in any realistic situation, we will omit relevant predictors from the model specification. Let's look at how this would affect our analysis by applying a single-variable model to the data from section 2.2, which varies in distance an number of bridges.
We will apply the single-variable model in order to model the data from section 2.2 (\textit{i.e., only yellow cabs, one passenger}). In a real-world scenario, we could use a model with missing predictors because because we did not consider those predictors relevant, or because we may not have information on them (\texit{i.e., we didn't record the number of bridges on our taxi rides through town}).

$$ fare = a + b * distance$$


The plot below is not as clean as the previous plots - and it doesn't seem to be possible to perfectly describe all the points by one line. While the average fare seems to increase with distance, there is also some variability in the fare at most distances. This is because the number of bridge crossings is unaccounted for. It is as if we were looking at a photo of a three-dimensional plot which was taken from the side.

In section 2, our system was deterministic since we knew every every variable that mattered and how it was to be included into the linear model equation. Once fail to account for some predictors that matter, the system becomes non-deterministic - we can't predict the fare exactly. In this case, this means that we can't predict the exact fare, if we don't know how many bridges were crossed on that taxi ride.  

Unlike previously, we can't solve a set of equations to arrive at coefficients that describe the data perfectly. But what we can do, is choose the coefficients such that the fare is predicted as well as possible. While we can't account for all variation in the fare, we can at least account for some of the structure in it - and the above plot shows that is *some* structure.

In order to account for omitted variables (or possibly true randomness in the data), we need to modify the linear model equation to the form below. 


$$ \underbrace{y_i}_{\text{Observed value}} =
            \overbrace{\underbrace{a}_{\text{Intercept}}}^{\text{additive term}} + 
            \overbrace{\underbrace{b_1}_{\text{Slope}} * \underbrace{{x_1}_i}_{Predictor}}^{\text{additive term}} + 
            \overbrace{\underbrace{b_2}_{\text{Slope}} * \underbrace{{x_2}_i}_{Predictor}}^{\text{additive term}} +  
            \ldots +
            \underbrace{\epsilon_i}_{Error}$$

The new element here is the *error term* $\epsilon$, while the rest of the equation is as previously. You can think of the equation as consisting of *three components*.

1. The intercept accounts for all *constants*, as well as the *average effect* of the omitted (and possibly even unknown predictors). 
<!-- (Importantly, the same would happen if those variables were not omitted, but their predictors were centered.) -->
<!-- Improve the phrasing above. -->
<!-- There is a lot to expand upon in that above statment. -->

2. The slopes account for all *variable effects* due to known predictors.

3. Meanwhile, the error $\epsilon$ term accounts for all *variable effects* due to omitted predictors. In regular linear models, we assume that $\epsilon$ follows a **normal distribution** with mean 0, and some unknown standard deviation $\sigma$. Assuming that it has a mean of 0 simply means that all deviations from the value predicted by the linear model sum to zero, which usually has the implication that *the line that the linear model describes is supposed to go through the point cloud*.

<!-- This is where the motivation for using the normal distribution goes. -->

## Finding the right coefficients

As mentioned previously, we want to find coefficient estimates which have the property that they minimize total prediction error. When we are estimating only one slope and one intercept, one way to think about this problem is that we are trying to find the highest point in the plot below. The plot shows the *negative* average absolute error (i.e., $-1 * \text{average absolute error}$) as a function of the values of intercept and slope. (I am using the *negative* absolute error because the error is easier to see in this case, as it forms a *'hill'* rather than a *'valley'*.)

The first plot shows the error surface for a wide range of values for intercept and slope, while the second plot shows the same for a more narrow range of values.

## Effects of Omitted Variables

Let's see how omitting variables affects our coefficient estimates. We know that in reality we pay $2.5~MNT$ for every kilometer travelled. And when we fit a linear model to a subset of the data, such that $N_{bridges}=0$, only day rides, only yellow cabs, and $N_{passenger}=1$, we get exactly those estimates.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
cab_fares2A <- cab_fares %>% subset(cab_color_red == 0 &
                                   n_passengers == 1 & 
                                   is_night == 0 &
                                   n_bridges %in% 0:1)

```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, data = cab_fares2A, subset = n_bridges == 0))

```


```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=2, fig.align='right'}

renderPlot({
  coefs <- coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, cab_fares2A))
  a = coefs[1]; b1 = coefs[2];

  p <- cab_fares2A %>% ggplot(aes(distance_km, fare_mnt)) + geom_point() + xlab("distance") + ylab("fare (MNT)")
  p <- p + geom_abline(intercept = a, slope = b1, color = "red")
  p + ggtitle(sprintf("fare = %0.2f + %0.2f*x", a, b1))
})
```


However, when we fit this model to the entire set of data, our estimates change somewhat. Why is that? And: what exactly determines how they change? 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, data = cab_fares2A))
```

In order to understand why the estimates change the way they do, let's zoom in on a tiny part of these data: Let's focus on measurements with the distances of $5~km$ 

Let's look at what happens if we look at what happens in subsets with $N_{bridges}=0$, $N_{bridges}=1$.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, data = cab_fares2, subset = n_bridges == 0))
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, data = cab_fares2, subset = n_bridges == 1))
```

As you see, if we analyze subset with $N_{bridges}=0$ and $N_{bridges}=1$ separately, we get the correct slope for distance, but the intercepts differ. This is because the subsets include different fees for bridge crossings. 

OK, so this explains why the intercept value is so odd when we pool the data. But what about the slope? Why don't we get the correct slope? We get an estimate that is, but not quite right. In oder to understand that let's zoom in on on a small subset of the data: Cab rides with distances of $5~km$ and $15~km$, respectively.  

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=2, fig.align='right'}

cab_fares2B <- subset(cab_fares2A, distance_km %in% c(5,15))

renderPlot({
  coefs <- coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, cab_fares2B))
  a = coefs[1]; b1 = coefs[2];

  p <- cab_fares2B %>% ggplot(aes(distance_km, fare_mnt)) + geom_point() + xlab("distance") + ylab("fare (MNT)")
  p <- p + geom_abline(intercept = a, slope = b1, color = "red")
  p + ggtitle(sprintf("fare = %0.2f + %0.2f*x", a, b1))
})
```

If you consider the plot above, along with the coefficient estimates below, you may start wondering what is going on. The slope estimate is even further away from the true value than before, and you can see in the plot that the regression line, does not pass in the middles between the two sets of data points.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, data = cab_fares2A, subset = distance_km %in% c(5,15) ))
```

The reason for the fact that the line seems to be too low is that there are actually different numbers of data points behind each point in the preceding graph. This is made clearer in the following plot, which uses jittering to illustrate the number of data points. The line gravitates towards the parts of the plot where there are more data points, because we are trying to minimize the average error. Thus being closer to many points, while being further away from a small number of points is better than being at equal distances to both, because the set of many datapoints influences the total average error more strongly than the set of few datapoints.  

```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=2, fig.align='right'}

renderPlot({
  coefs <- coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, cab_fares2B))
  a = coefs[1]; b1 = coefs[2];

  p <- cab_fares2B %>% ggplot(aes(distance_km, fare_mnt)) + geom_jitter(height = .5, width = .5) + xlab("distance") + ylab("fare (MNT)")
  p <- p + geom_abline(intercept = a, slope = b1, color = "red")
  p + ggtitle(sprintf("fare = %0.2f + %0.2f*x", a, b1))
})
```

Because there are different numbers of observations for the different combinations of distance and $N_{bridges}$ (i.e., because the data is *unbalanced*), distance and $N_{bridges}$ appear to be correlated. The result is that at each value of distance, we have a different contribution of the effect of number of bridges. 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
cab_fares2B %>% group_by(distance_km) %>% dplyr::summarize(avg_n_bridges = mean(n_bridges))
```
<!-- Is this really the entire explanation? -->

De-correlating them is easy in this example. All we need to do is to reduce the dataset to four unique points. Let's do that and take another look at the estimates.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
coef(lm(fare_mnt ~ distance_km, data = cab_fares2A %>% subset(distance_km %in% c(5,15)) %>% unique ))
```

When the correlation between distance and bridges disappears, we get the estimates which we know to be correct.
In sum, our previous estimates were slightly off because a spurious correlation between distance and bridges caused us to mis-estimate the slope - and since the best intercept estimate is dependent on the slope estimate (as illustrated in the 3D plots above), the intercept estimate ends up being different too.
<!-- TODO: This is where i should say that centering will help, because at least the intercept that is 'off' will yield an interpretable number if predictors are centered. -->


# Generalized Linear Models

Introduce generalized linear models with an example that where a predictor has a multiplicative effect on probabilities. Discuss that it's very implausible for anything to have an additive effect on probabilities.
The ultimate model should still be deterministic.
